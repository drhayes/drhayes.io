I switched over to Gatsby because Ruby is kind of annoying and because I'm more of a JavaScript tinkerer than a Ruby "it just works leave it alone"-er.

I also switched the site publishing process from Netlify to a [CircleCI][] configuration that publishes directly to an S3 bucket via the [AWS SDK][awssdk]. I just can't leave well enough alone, I guess.
