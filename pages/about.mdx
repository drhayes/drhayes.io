# About :wave:

My name is David Hayes. I do stuff with computers. I live in Austin, TX.

This site is made with some help from these technologies and media:

* [Sublime Text 3][sublime] is where the typing happens.
* [Visual Studio Code][vsc] is also where the typing happens.
* [Markdown] has the content.
* Something generates the site.
* [GitHub][github] hosts the code.
* [Amazon AWS][aws] publishes the site via S3.
* [Cloudflare][cloudflare] makes it fast.
* [CircleCI][circleci] builds it when it changes.

## Contact Me
