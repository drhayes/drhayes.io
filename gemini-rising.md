# Gemini Rising

Gemini Rising is a Metroidvania with crafting elements and procedural generation that I'm writing. It should be out "soon".

My goal is to make the entire game by myself: programming, graphics, sound, and music.

I will be documenting the process here on my site. Beyond blog articles updating about my progress, I also wanted to write articles about problems I encountered and the solutions I've come up with to those problems.

## Video Dev Log

Here's a list of videos I've made of the game's progress so far. My game was codenamed "Basement".
