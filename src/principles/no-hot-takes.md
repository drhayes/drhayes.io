As much as possible, eschew pithy statements on complex topics (but stretch thy vocab, obviously).

I like being thought of as clever, and I prize communication and understanding and wit. It's generally easy for me to find the quick, witty, humorous take on something and, generally, I think the Internet awards it. But I also want more nuance in my positions, not a "both-sides" simplicity, but a slightly deeper exploration on contentious topics than I'm normally willing to give.
