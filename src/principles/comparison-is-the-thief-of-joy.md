Comparing yourself to others is a great way to beat yourself up for nearly no gain.

I don't have the full story. I maybe don't actually know who they are. Even if I do, I'm not interested in being better than someone else, I'm interested in being the best possible me I can be, to experience everything the world has to offer instead of dwelling in my head on imagined faults.

That means Practice self-compassion.
