description: Comparing yourself to others is a great way to beat yourself up for no gain.

I don't have the full story. I maybe don't actually know who they are. Even if I do, I'm not interested in being _better than someone else_, I'm interested in being _the best possible me I can be_, to experience everything the world has to offer instead of dwelling in my head on imagined faults.

I should practice self-compassion instead.
