This one goes out to my ADHD homies.

I repeat this to myself multiple times a week when dealing with particularly ADHD times:

* When I'm feeling low on executive function, when I just can't start that boring, repetitive task that I know I need to get done.
* When I despair at my interest in yet another productivity app that promises that this time, **this time**, I'll be able to organize my everything in a way that makes sense.
* When I look around my office and wonder, **again**, how it came to be such a mess.

Stop trying to be good at things you're bad at. They feel like moral flaws because our society isn't built for brains like yours.

I think it's entirely possible to misuse this principle, to think that I'm arguing that people shouldn't strive to improve themselves, but that's not what I'm talking about. I'm not talking about how you are a terrible piano player and you shouldn't try to get better -- I'm talking about wrestling against a disability disguised as a moral failure.
