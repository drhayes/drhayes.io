Shouldn't be arguable, and yet.

If words didn't matter, then it wouldn't be called "tax relief" or a "death tax". If words didn't matter, we'd use the pronouns someone prefers. If words didn't matter, advertising wouldn't be a thing. Yet, in all those cases, someone has chosen the particular words they are using because of what they mean.

They're communicating something.

How someone frames an issue that they're speaking or writing about tells you a lot about what they are thinking, where they're coming from. Listen to them and believe them.
