It's a well-known online strategy conservatives use to raise engagement with their social media posts. Every retweet or quote raises the number of people who see the garbage they're saying, so don't do it. They know what they're saying isn't true, they are trying to spark outrage and paint the liberals as smug know-it-alls. If you need to comment on it, screenshot it. Signal-boost your friends.
