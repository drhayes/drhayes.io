There are some corollaries to this, though:

- Practice self-compassion when you do make a mistake.
- Be accountable and take responsibility for your mistake.
- We're all in this together.
- If it's okay to make mistakes, it's okay to tell people about them. Be careful about "not naming names", that can create a culture of shame around mistakes.
