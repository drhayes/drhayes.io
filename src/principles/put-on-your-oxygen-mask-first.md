description: What good am I to others if I don't take care of myself, first?

If I'm not taking care of myself first then I'm no good to Julian.

I tend to think that if I'm not right by his side as he's going through something that I'm abandoning him. This idea usually has a couple of misconceptions wrapped up in it:

- **I'm** the one that's usually upset in these scenarios. I'm really thinking about me.
- I'm probably not going to be my best self taking care of him if I'm really upset.

It's important to remember this when having tough parenting moments. My tough parenting moments are usually caused by me, not by him.
