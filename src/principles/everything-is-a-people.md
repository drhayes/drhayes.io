It sounds dumb to put it quite like that, why not "person"? Mostly because I'm starting to think that consciousness only "works" in aggregate, when compared to another mind, in the entangled space between the minds and their perceptions of each other. In my own limited case, I have only my perception of myself and the other.

So, if I'm tempted to ask, "Is this thing conscious?" then the only answer my brain can give me is, "Probably, yeah."
