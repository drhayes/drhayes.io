Behold the Generic Platformer!

I wanted to make an open source game that I (and others) could use as a template for small game projects going forward. It's using a couple of things I want to make their own libraries in the future.

[Check it out on GitHub here][generic-platformer].

It has a [pretty extensive README][gp-readme] detailing how it's written and how to read the code.
