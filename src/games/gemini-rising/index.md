Gemini Rising is a Metroidvania with crafting elements and procedural generation that I'm working on. It is out now for pre-alpha testing!

My goal is to make the entire game by myself: programming, graphics, sound, and music.

## Video Dev Log

Here's a list of videos I've made of the game's progress so far. My game was codenamed "Basement" before I came up with its current title.
