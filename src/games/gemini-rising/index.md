Gemini Rising is a puzzle platformer about angry robots and hacking that I'm working on. It is out now for pre-alpha testing!

My goal is to make the entire game by myself: programming, graphics, sound, and music.

[Check out the "gemini-rising" tag for blog posts about it](/tags/gemini-rising).

You can grab the game on itch.io:

## Video Dev Log

Here's a list of videos I've made of the game's progress so far. My game was codenamed "Basement" before I came up with its current title.

I've also recently taken a hard right turn regarding the scope of the game. More on that soon.
