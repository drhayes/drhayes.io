Written in Godot over about fourteen hours for the Mini Jam, I ran out of time before being able to make more levels or provide better feedback. Overall I'm pretty happy with the game. I'm not sure I'm going to spend more time improving it from where it is, the jury is still out.

I can't open source this one as I'm using a couple of purchased, non-open-source assets. Here are the assets I used:

* Cute cat sprite by SeethingSwarm, found at https://seethingswarm.itch.io/catset
* Font is "Scarab" by ChevyRay: https://chevyray.itch.io/pixel-font-megapack
* UI borders from "Fantasy UI Borders" by the inimitable Kenney: https://kenney.nl/assets/fantasy-ui-borders

I owe my site a write-up about my experience making this game. Soon(tm).
