My pronouns are he/him.

I do stuff with computers. I live in Austin, TX.

I'm a dad.

I love jokes, especially dad jokes. But that was before I was a dad and it's only gotten worse since.

I love everything game (board and digital and role-playing), plain text formats, productivity, and knowledge management.

I'm a musician. I've played the piano since I was very young, and I very much like making music with things that look like [trackers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_tracker).

I like keyboards that make too much noise, especially ergodox keyboards.

## Contact Me

I can be found pretty much everywhere fine Internets are made as `drhayes` or some variation.

In particular, you can email me at <hi@drhayes.io> or [chat me at my Keybase chat][keybasechat] or [at my Telegram address you weirdo][telegram].

You could also use my [public inbox](https://lists.sr.ht/~drhayes/public-inbox) or email me at <~drhayes/public-inbox@lists.sr.ht> to get a post started. It's this idea that I found via [Eric Bower](https://bower.sh/) that I thought I'd try out.

Here are some likely haunts:
