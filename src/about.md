My pronouns are he/him. I do stuff with computers. I live in Austin, TX.

I'm a dad. I love jokes, especially dad jokes. But that was before I was a dad and it's only gotten worse since.

I love everything game (board and digital and role-playing)

I dig on plain text formats, productivity, and knowledge management.

I'm a musician. I've played the piano since I was very young, and I very much like making music with things that look like [trackers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_tracker).

I like keyboards that make too much noise, especially ergodox keyboards.

I like to think I'm a mentor, but I'm still learning how to do that myself from people who are really good at it.

## Contact Me

I can be found pretty much everywhere fine Internets are made as `drhayes` or some variation.

In particular, you can email me at <hi@drhayes.io> or [chat me at my Keybase chat][keybasechat] or [at my Telegram address you weirdo][telegram].

You could also use my [public inbox](https://lists.sr.ht/~drhayes/public-inbox) or email me at <~drhayes/public-inbox@lists.sr.ht> to get a post started. It's this idea that I found via [Eric Bower](https://bower.sh/) that I thought I'd try out.

### Credits

I _adore_ seeing how other people solve similar issues to mine. I think we all get smarter when we share solutions.

Some 11ty organization ideas came from:

- [Zach Leatherman](https://www.zachleat.com/): <https://github.com/zachleat/zachleat.com>
  - I mean, the guy wrote 11ty so he has some ideas about how to use it.
- [Sophie Koonin](https://localghost.dev/): <https://github.com/sophiekoonin/localghost/>
  - meta tags, excerpts, OpenGraph image generation
  - Good Markdown plugin suggestions:
    - markdown-it-image-figures
- [Lea Verou](https://lea.verou.me): <https://github.com/LeaVerou/lea.verou.me>
  - Lots of good Markdown plugin stuff that I suddenly, desperately needed
  - I love how her site blanks out tags that are only used once.
  - also, for teaching me CSS in general, really
- `<aside>` boxes shamelessly copied from [css-irl.info](https://css-irl.info/disentangling-frameworks/)
