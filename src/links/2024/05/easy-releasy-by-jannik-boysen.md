This template pack contains a bunch of images in the right formats and sizes to help you make nice looking itch.io pages.

I love itch.io. The site is a great resource for finding indie games, game development resources, role-playing games, fonts, tools -- all kinds of fun stuff.

When it comes time to make my own pages for itch.io I have no idea what I'm doing, though. I know the pages need graphics and I know I want them to reflect the look and feel of whatever games I'm publishing, but I feel like I'm in the dark about what actual assets I need.

This template pack works like a signpost of the resources you might need. That's just right for me and hopefully is useful for other people.
