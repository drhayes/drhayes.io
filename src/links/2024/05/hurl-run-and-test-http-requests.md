CLI tool for running and testing HTTP requests with a flat file config for asserting on the responses: https://hurl.dev/docs/asserting-response.html You can capture stuff from earlier responses to feed into subsequent requests like CSRF tokens and whatnot.

I totally want to start piling up `hurl` files in my repo as all kinds of tests: sanity tests, diff tests, etc.

It also has a fantastic name.
