Found again via a re-read of a random entry in my journal.

Has a great lesson in walking the line between writing about how you're thinking and writing about *what* you're thinking; if you're interested in writing about the thinking process or showing people your thinking process. And I agree with Robin, here, I like the voices of the two pieces -- chaotic, a little rambly, they let you in... but not *all* the way in.
