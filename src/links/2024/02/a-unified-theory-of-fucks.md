title: A unified theory of fucks
description: If you only have so many fucks to give, at least make sure you're giving a fuck to something that might give some back.

I like this one a lot.

I like that a person's energy and drive is acknowledged as a finite resource, and that some things are plain just *consumers* of that energy without giving a lot back. For example, giving a fuck about your job is kinda okay I guess -- but giving a fuck about the people who work with you, or the people who your company serves, those are both so much better because they'll give something back to you. At least, they'll be better able to give a fuck back then some abstract organization that pays you money.
