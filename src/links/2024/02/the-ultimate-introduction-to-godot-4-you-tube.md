This was the introduction to Godot that started it all for me.

I'm not a video guy; I _much_ prefer reading documentation over trying to focus on what someone is saying (ADHD kinda sucks that way).

This video was different, though. I set it to 1.5x speed, put on my earbuds, and plowed through it, repeating as needed when I needed more clarity on something. I could jump to things I was interested in... and then jump back when I realized I didn't know enough to understand what he was talking about.

I think part of what worked for me is that it tended to skim in the right places. It treated me like a programmer who reads documentation, and a gamedev who kinda-sorta knows what I'm doing (even though I don't, not really). It taught me the vocabulary I needed to find things in the [well-written Godot documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/).
