I'm *jealous* of this kind of integrated environment. I want more of this!

The real work of software development isn't "programming" or code, that's just the unavoidable (and sometimes regrettable!) cost of delivering the technology solution to someone -- kinda like how burning jet fuel isn't the purpose of the airline industry.

I don't know what to do about any of this, I guess, other than keep my eye out for people like [Bret Victor](https://worrydream.com/) who are doing something about this.
