Given that [YAML wants to be a programming language now](https://thenewstack.io/with-yamlscript-yaml-becomes-a-proper-programming-language/) it's probably time to keep this webpage handy. YAML is just full of chaos bombs waiting to blow you up. Thanks, YAML.

I fully accept that JSON isn't very humane or pleasant for regular ol' humans to type, but I'd argue that -- given YAML's hilarities -- it's a better choice.

If JSON won't due, I'd prefer [TOML](https://toml.io/en/).
