This whole essay is sobering and kinda depressing. But I found this quote especially enlightening:

> “I also find myself explaining to them how the iteration and 'idea' phase of a project is where the best stuff happens, how exploring things through artistic labor is where your best ideas come to fruition, and why would we want an AI (that we don't even own) to do that for us with art that isn't ours to use?”

I'd never, ever thought of creative work quite like that and it makes so much sense!
That a creative work isn't the outcome of a creative process, exactly, but the creative process **itself** is the worthwhile thing.

It removes a framing of creative work I wasn't aware I was carrying around and that was definitely limiting my own creative expression!
