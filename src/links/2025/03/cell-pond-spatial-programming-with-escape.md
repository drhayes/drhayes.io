You can [play with CellPond right here](https://cellpond.cool).

The [git repo for CellPond is here](https://github.com/TodePond/Cellpond).

I adore this so much. I don't spend a ton of time thinking about different ways to do the activity we call programming, but I often tell people that the act of typing characters into a text file is not the whole of it -- maybe not even the most of it. What's important is the brain behind it, guiding the process of figuring out how to tell a computer to do what you want.

If anything, making people type characters into text files that have strict syntactic rules is a **barrier** to expression at best, and a [physical danger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury) at worst.

This project exemplifies that so well! And I love the idea that the UI "fell out" somehow, even though I'm blown away by the UI... even if Lu assures me that I shouldn't be.
