My name is David Hayes. I do stuff with computers. I live in Austin, TX.

## The Site

[Here is the source for the site][drhayes.io].

It is generated using the following tools:

  * [Hugo][] for static site generation.
  * [Prism][prismjs] for code highlighting.
  * [Markdown][] for writing like a human.
  * [Netlify][] for hosting.

Cool link effect brazenly stolen from [jake.ly][jakely].
