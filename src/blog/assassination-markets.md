The inimitable [Molly White](https://www.mollywhite.net) published an article on [Citation Needed](https://www.citationneeded.news) (sign up! Give her money!) about some bets on the website Kalshi that seem to steer suspiciously close to "assassination markets".

Here's Molly's article: <https://www.citationneeded.news/trump-death-bets/>

I'd never heard that term before.
From [Wikipedia's article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_market), grabbed 2025-09-04:

> An assassination market is a prediction market where any party can place a bet... on the date of death of a given individual. This incentivises assassination of the individual, as parties with advanced knowledge of an assassination plot can profit by betting accurately on the date of the death. Because the payoff is for accurately picking the date rather than performing the assassination, it is substantially more difficult to assign criminal liability.

This would be a cool idea if we were talking theoretically, or if I'd encountered this idea in a cyberpunk dystopia novel.
But we're talking about real life and I'm horrified.
Worst timeline.
