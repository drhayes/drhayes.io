I fell into an [emacs][] hole the last couple of weeks. I'm liable to try any productivity system you put in front of me for at least a little bit, and emacs' [org-mode][] is pretty much the king. And I can definitely see the benefits of a fully developed [org-based workflow][voit-org], especially as someone who constantly writes things down in little notebooks and [various][keep] [other][evernote] [digital][notion] [nooks][standardnotes].

The worst of these tools create piles of notes that impossible to organize. Slightly less worse are tools that trap my notes in proprietary systems I don't control. The only real answer is [plain-text][text], of course.

The most ambitious plain-text, analog note system I've ever seen is [zettelkasten][zk]. Essentially, you write notes on index cards and assiduously tag and index them, keeping them forever in a slip box. Notes can refer to other notes in an ingenious analog addressing system.
