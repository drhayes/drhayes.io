I have ADHD.
I sometimes get hyperfocused on things.

## Definition

[Additude Magazine defines hyperfocus as:](https://www.additudemag.com/understanding-adhd-hyperfocus/)

> ... an intense fixation on an interest or activity for an extended period of time. People who experience hyperfocus often become so engrossed they block out the world around them.

Yeah, that about sums it up.

## But... Feelings!

The definition leaves out the emotional truth of it, though, the actual experience of being pushed around by an [interest-driven nervous system](https://www.additudemag.com/adhd-brain-chemistry-video/).

Sometimes it's like an excited person that keeps shoving something in front of my face no matter how much I wish he'd go away.
I keep having to push them aside to get anything done and I'm not always successful.

Sometimes it's like a tow hook that is jammed underneath my sternum, dragging me forward almost against my will.

Other times it's this mad, panicky rush to get something done to the exclusion of nearly everything else: family, friends, hunger, even bathroom breaks.
That allure of "just one more thing" and "just real quick" and then, one time-blindness later, **BAM** -- you're late, it's dark, please stop.

You might get a song stuck in your head.
I've listened to [the song](/blog/breakaway/) nearly seventy times in the last three days, listened to a podcast episode that hosted the singer, found the song it's a cover of, learned to play it on the piano, dug into [the meaning behind the lyrics](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/dec/02/breakaway-by-big-pig-fighting-fate-and-longing-for-freedom), journaled about what it meant to me when I first heard it, what it means to me now... on and on and on.

## Whoa, there, buddy

This isn't some contest.
I'm not a *más que tú*[^1] that's going for gold in the pain Olympics or something.

And, yeah, sometimes it's helpful when I want to power through something, or take a deep dive into some esoteric subject.
People sometimes talk about hyperfocus as one of the "ADHD superpowers" and I can't deny it's useful on occasion, no matter how I feel about the "ADHD as superpower" narrative[^2].

But I think people who don't have ADHD don't *know*, they don't know what it's *really* like.

And I realized that I never see other people writing about it, about how it feels on the inside.
So I thought I'd put it out there.

[^1]: "More than you", like that person who always has to one-up you about stuff.
[^2]: I don't think I like it, for what it's worth.
