Very much inspired by the likes of [Bret Victor's Quotes page](https://worrydream.com/#!/quotes) I finally published a page of [interesting words](/words). Any time I come across a word I don't know that hits me a certain way, I add it to the list with its definition.

There's no theme that I'm aware of that links them other than they seemed kinda neat.

Some are **totally** goth, like ["noctivagant"](/words/#noctivagant). I definitely feel some of them on a deeper level, like ["torschlusspanik"](/words/#torschlusspanik).

 The whole thing is definitely a little [recherche](/words/#recherche).
