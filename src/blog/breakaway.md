My ADHD sometimes drives me to listen to songs over and over again in a fit of hyperfocus.

One of the most recent ones is "Breakaway", by Big Pig; I'm pretty sure I first heard during the titles of "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure".

I adore this song.
I love the sort of apocalyptic feel of it, the evocative language:

> Like a child in his fantasy\
> Punching holes in the walls of reality

I just learned that it's a cover of this amazing soul tune by Chuck Jackson titled "I Can't Break Away" from 1973:

The organ!
The strings!
That guitar riff!

Ever heard the phrase, "Friends don't let friends clap on the down beat"?
This song feels like it does *nothing* on the down beat, and all the vocals have these short phrasings that keep it moving in a really brain-scratching way.
That's a good thing.

And it has the same "omina, doke doe, onimea" stuff that the Big Pig version has!
I want there to be some hidden, Easter egg meaning to that phrase but I think it might be a kind of scat.
My limited Wikipedia-based research hasn't turned up anything, at least.

Chuck Jackson was inducted into the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame in 2015.
He [died in 2023](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/23/chuck-jackson-obituary).
