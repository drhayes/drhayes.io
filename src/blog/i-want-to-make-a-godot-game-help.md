It's like eleven hours long but it's really good:

Video content normally doesn't work for me. I read really fast and normally can't pay attention to tutorial videos for ADHD reasons. But this one is just great: the presenter doesn't mess around with a bunch of extraneous stuff (no "commentlikeandsubscribe" stuff), they explain what they're going to do in concise terms, and they're building a single project over a series of videos rather than making a series of "hello world" examples that don't actually explain anything.

With the recent Unity fiasco I was browsing around the web and came upon [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) again. I'd tried it before (along with [Defold](https://defold.com/)) but it hadn't really stuck; I'm a coder through and through, and the idea of being beholden to a visual editor to do anything seemed like an unwanted workflow burden, an unnecessary speedbump between my ideas and getting the computer to do stuff. I feel productive in my [text editor](https://neovim.io/) and had a hard time imagining giving that up.

My [current game](/games/gemini-rising) is made in [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/) and is Makefile-driven. It's currently about 184 Lua files containing around 10k lines of code (not including libraries) and... is kinda big. I probably bit off more than I can chew, especially with part-time development that goes in fits and starts.

So what if I took a break from _that_ game to make some kind of _smaller_ game, just to try Godot out, see what I think? Why not.

I've been thinking about how to do horror in 2d right -- a lot of the horror games I see Let's-Players playing are 3d, usually analog horror games. [Endoparasitic](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2124780/Endoparasitic/) stands out as a glorious 2d exception that I find very inspiring. Sci-fi body horror? Sign me up.

Time to go to the drawing board, literally -- can I make a non-pixel-art 2d top-down sci-fi horror game in Godot and release it? I guess I'll find out!
