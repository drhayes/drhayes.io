I noticed that [Julia Evans posted an image of beta readers giving her feedback about her latest zine about `git`](https://social.jvns.ca/@b0rk/112090137054204665).
The screenshot that accompanied the toot blew me away.

I saw actionable, categorized feedback with (what I'm assuming are) little todo checkboxes for acknowledging feedback.
I've been thinking a lot about how to make better cross-team documentation at work, so this caught my eye.

I got over my normal social media reticence and sent her a message asking how it was done.
[She told me](https://social.jvns.ca/@b0rk/112090429484229827) that it was a custom site that she built to aid in gathering feedback!

[She even blogged about it already](https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/03/31/zine-feedback-site/)!

If I did something like this at work I'd want to think about the kind of categories we'd use and not just ape the ones she came up with.
Then again, "I have a question!" and "I have a suggestion!" seem pretty applicable to any kind of technical writing.

Thanks, Julia!
