I'd wanted to do it for forever, and then I came across [Sophie Koonin's excellent write-up about how to get it working for static sites](https://localghost.dev/blog/sending-webmentions-from-a-static-site/) and I figured that the Internet had sent me a sign.

Also, she basically lays out everything step-by-step and had a great solution for making sure that you don't over-notify the sites that you mention (a concern I'd had as well that had prevented me from sending webmentions before).

Hopefully I didn't pester her too much while I was getting it working.
