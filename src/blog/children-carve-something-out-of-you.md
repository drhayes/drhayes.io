My son has been sick for a couple of weeks.

<!--more-->

It's nothing critical, but it *is* kinda serious.
After a couple of tries the doctors found the antibiotics that seem to be clearing it up and he's on the mend.

Once his illness hung on longer than a few days I became wound tight as a spring, irritated and frustrated and angry.
He's getting better now, and I'm slowly unwinding.

It's not completely apropos to this situation, but it put me in mind of this quote from Penny Arcade about "manipulative" writing where children are put in danger:

> When I was younger, I would have resented some of this stuff - it would have seemed ham-handed. Manipulative. I could have discerned what they wanted me to feel and valiantly refused, or (if it were executed especially well) felt a version of it which might have been similar in color or shape. I would feel it in deference to their craft.

> Thatâ€™s not really how it works now. Children carve something out of you, a place for themselves; people can twist the knife in that spot, and it just bleeds and bleeds.
> <cite>Jerry Holkins (Tycho) from [Penny Arcade](https://penny-arcade.com)</cite>

[I stopped reading Penny Arcade a long time ago](https://www.wired.com/2013/09/penny-arcade-expo-dickwolves/) but this has stuck with me.
