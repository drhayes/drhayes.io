What I'm doing right now.

## Text

Trying to stay in the habit of updating my site on the regular.

Check out my [Projects][] note.

Working on a tumbley-loggy thing over at [wisps][]. Tags and editorializing work. But I still want
to add pictures and music and things.

## Gamedev

* Haven't been thinking about digital gamedev at all. It's been nice, actually.
* Been reading and re-reading [Cortex][cortex] and wanting, mightily, to make a game.
  * Maybe a solo game!
  * [Notes on a solo RPG][notesolorpg]
  * Don't just make yet another sci-fi/fantasy game.

## Digital Games

* I'm basically playing no video games right now. Ugh.

## Role-playing Games

* Playing in a [Masks][] campaign with Internet strangers! A curated [Magpie][] game turned campaign. It's going great! Talk to me about the between-game vignettes.
* About to start a [Beam Saber][beamsaber] game while one of the Dracula Dossier group goes on
  maternity leave! There's not enough Forged in the Dark in my life.

## Teaching

Do I just accept that I'm not going to write about teaching in an organized way and just make
[notes][drhayesdigitalgarden] about it? Might be the way to go.

## Programming

[Work continues on the digital garden][drhayesdigitalgarden]. I've left the code alone for a while
now, it's working for me. Been thinking about adding tag pages, also been thinking about adding some
kind of crude search engine.

Switched teams at work to a more data-ish, ML-ish team. It's nice to not be a cost center again.

Thinking about pulling [Tailwind][tailwind] out of my site, since I want to do more custom things with the CSS.

## Music

ON REPEAT: [MAYDAY by TheFatRat featuring Laura Brehm][mayday]

Lately.

* TheFatRat.
* Boom Kitty. (Boom Slayer is ridic awesome, and the Geometry Dash level to match)
* Daniel Deluxe.
* John Carpenter.

Always.

* [Carpenter Brut][carpenterbrut] - Basically everything
* [Makeup and Vanity Set][mavs] - Basically everything
* [ACTORS - It Will Come To You][actors]
* [KANGA - Eternal Daughter and Kanga][kanga] (but, also, basically everything)
* [Blanck Mass][BlanckMass]

Occasionally.

* Dance with the Dead
* Holy Fuck
* Perturbator
