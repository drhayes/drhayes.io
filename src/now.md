## Socials

I can now be found as [@drhayes@social.lol](https://social.lol/@drhayes).

Speaking of my preferred client, that would be <https://elk.zone>. Tres cool. But considering going straight Masto on the web, not sure...

You can also find me on [Bookwyrm](https://bookwyrm.social/user/drhayes). I'm trying to be good about what I'm logging, but no guarantees.

## Text

Actively working on the site redesign, it just keeps getting deprioritized for dumb things like vacations and spending time with friends. _gOsH_.

I found the [eleventy-plugin-syntaxhighlight](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-plugin-syntaxhighlight) project courtesy of [zachleat](https://zachleat.com) and recently converted my site to use that. Just after I finished that I found [Torchlight](https://torchlight.dev/), which seems kinda cool but I'm not sure I need it or want to get some highlight-as-a-service thing going.

## Role-playing Games

Back for what is our final season of Masks with these characters!

## Programming

But what about Rust, though?

Swapped my nvim config to something more custom, all built off [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim).

## Music

ON REPEAT: "So Just Hang On, Beautiful One" by Au4 and "Light Cycles" by ShockOne.

Lately.

- On a Makeup and Vanity Set kick.

Always.

- [Carpenter Brut][carpenterbrut]
- [Makeup and Vanity Set][mavs]
- [ACTORS - It Will Come To You][actors]
- [KANGA - Eternal Daughter and Kanga][kanga] (but, also, basically everything)

## What's this again?

This is a [Now][nowpage] page. You should have one too.
