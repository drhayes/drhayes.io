What I'm doing right now.

## Texas Winter

Now it alternates between kind of cold and kind of wet. Not unpleasantly, mind, but distractingly.

## Socials

I can now be found as [@drhayes@indieweb.social](https://indieweb.social/@drhayes). I'm also thinking about moving to <https://social.lol>, but we'll see.

I forgot about that little squirt of dopamine one gets when people dig the things you post. That's not great and something I actually want to avoid. Maybe I should turn notifications off for my preferred client.

Speaking of my preferred client, that would be https://elk.zone. Tres cool.

You can also find me on [Bookwyrm](https://bookwyrm.social/user/drhayes). I'm trying to be good about what I'm logging, but no guarantees.

## Text

Upgraded the website to the latest 11ty beta, looks like things are okay around here. Thinking about a redesign, getting me out of the corporate straight-and-narrow look.

## Role-playing Games

We're heading back to City of Mists!

## Programming

But what about Rust, though?

Swapped my config to something more custom, all built off [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim).

## Music

ON REPEAT: "So Just Hang On, Beautiful One" by Au4 and "Light Cycles" by ShockOne.

Lately.

* On a Makeup and Vanity Set kick.

Always.

* [Carpenter Brut][carpenterbrut]
* [Makeup and Vanity Set][mavs]
* [ACTORS - It Will Come To You][actors]
* [KANGA - Eternal Daughter and Kanga][kanga] (but, also, basically everything)


## What's this again?

This is a [Now][nowpage] page. You should have one too.
