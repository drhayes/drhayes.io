## Overall

Things are cold down here in Texas. But I bet we haven't seen our last freeze.

## üé≤ Role-playing Games

We're playing [Homebrew World](https://spoutinglore.blogspot.com/2018/07/homebrew-world.html) and [Fabula Ultima](https://need.games/fabula-ultima/) right now and having a lot of fun. I wonder if I should write up something about my characters and post it to the site, hmm...

## üñ•Ô∏è Programming

Playing around with Go. Still doing (mostly) JS for work.

## üé∂ Music

ON REPEAT: "Headlights" by Ashbury Heights.

Always.

- [Carpenter Brut][carpenterbrut]
- [Makeup and Vanity Set][mavs]
- [ACTORS - It Will Come To You][actors]
- [KANGA - Under Glass][kanga] (but, also, basically everything)
- [Hunter as a Horse - The Lost Tapes EP](https://hunterasahorse.bandcamp.com/album/walk-with-fire) - So witchy! So good!

## What's this again?

This is a [Now][nowpage] page. You should have one too.
