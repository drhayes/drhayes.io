What I'm doing right now.

## Fun Stuff

Whoops, spoke too soon -- it's warm again for a bit. That's the Central Texas fall, though -- sometimes warm, sometimes chilly, usually blustery, sometimes rainy. We're gearing up for Christmas and, so far, succeeding in not going all out.

## Socials

I can now be found as [@drhayes@indieweb.social](https://indieweb.social/@drhayes). I keep getting attracted to other instances (looking at you <https://hachyderm.io>), but sticking with this one for now.

The other instance I keep looking at is <https://social.lol>. The good news is that I added a [webfinger](https://webfinger.net/) resource to my website, so if you search for `@drhayes@drhayes.io` it'll resolve to my current account. That should make transitioning, should I decide to do it in the future, a breeze.

## Text

I'm finally free of my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) obsession! I woke up a couple of days ago, mentally shook myself like a dog shaking water out of its fur, and gratefully went back to TiddlyWiki. If you're also a TiddlyWiki user and can afford it, consider supporting them via [the TiddlyWiki Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/tiddlywiki).

Still thinking about upgrading some [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) stuff on the ol' website, especially around webmentions.

## Role-playing Games

We're heading back to City of Mists!

## Programming

Experimenting with Go and [Charm][]. Is it possible to love a startup because of their TUI libraries? I'm living proof.

Still liking [LunarVim](https://www.lunarvim.org) a lot.

## Music

ON REPEAT: "Hard Times" by Paramore and "So Just Hang On, Beautiful One" by Au4.

Lately.

* Paramore
* Hunter As a Horse
* The Beta Machine

Always.

* [Carpenter Brut][carpenterbrut]
* [Makeup and Vanity Set][mavs]
* [ACTORS - It Will Come To You][actors]
* [KANGA - Eternal Daughter and Kanga][kanga] (but, also, basically everything)
* [Blanck Mass][BlanckMass]

Occasionally.

* Dance with the Dead
* Holy Fuck
* Perturbator


## What's this again?

This is a [Now][nowpage] page. You should have one too.
