What I'm doing right now.

## Fun Stuff

Getting Halloween decorations up. Our house has been decorated since the end of September, but we're re-working our giant spider and she's taking a bit longer than we'd thought.

## Text

Still doing lots of note work in [Tiddlywiki](https://tiddlywiki.com). Trying to figure out if there's anything in there I want to export (there is!) and how to do it safely. I've been doing a daily journal practice in there with some intensely personal stuff that I don't want to leak to the Internet at large. Definitely taking some cues from [Soren's zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.sorenbjornstad.com) on this one.

## Role-playing Games

The [Masks][] campaign is back for season two. Things are bigger and more complicated. So many feelings.

## Programming

Experimenting with Go and [Charm][]. Is it possible to love a startup because of their TUI libraries? I'm living proof.

Playing with a [LunarVim](https://www.lunarvim.org/) config for my preferred editor. It's very nice, mostly takes the pain out of neovim config.

## Music

ON REPEAT: "Hard Times" by Paramore.

Lately.

* Paramore
* Hunter As a Horse
* The Beta Machine

Always.

* [Carpenter Brut][carpenterbrut]
* [Makeup and Vanity Set][mavs]
* [ACTORS - It Will Come To You][actors]
* [KANGA - Eternal Daughter and Kanga][kanga] (but, also, basically everything)
* [Blanck Mass][BlanckMass]

Occasionally.

* Dance with the Dead
* Holy Fuck
* Perturbator
