What I'm doing right now.

## Text

Trying to stay in the habit of updating my site on the regular.

Doing a decent job of updating Now and [Projects][]. Not doing as good a job at tending to my notes. Trying to carefully read [How to Take Smart Notes][smartnotes]

Check out my [Projects][] note.

## Gamedev

* Haven't been thinking about digital gamedev at all. It's been nice, actually.
* Been reading and re-reading [Cortex][cortex] and wanting, mightily, to make a game.
  * Maybe a solo game!
  * [Notes on a solo RPG][notesolorpg]
  * Don't just make yet another sci-fi/fantasy game.

## Digital Games

* I'm basically playing no video games right now. Ugh.

## Role-playing Games

* [The Dracula Dossier][dracula] is very fun. We're back in England, but with lower heat. Except
  we're circling on of the HQs of an organization that wants us dead, trying to break in.
* Playing in a [Masks][] campaign with Internet strangers! A curated [Magpie][] game turned campaign. It's going great! Talk to me about the between-game vignettes.

## Teaching

Need to write more about what how my teaching is going.

## Programming

Mostly Terraform at work. Mostly JavaScript at home as I poke at my personal site and a notes
system. Lua for anything gamedev-y, but I'm eyeing Rust.

Thinking about pulling [Tailwind][tailwind] out of my site, since I want to do more custom things with the CSS.

## Music

Lately.

* Com Truise.
* Angel Olsen.
* Daniel Deluxe.

Always.

* [Carpenter Brut][carpenterbrut] - Basically everything
* [Makeup and Vanity Set][mavs] - Basically everything
* [ACTORS - It Will Come To You][actors]
* [KANGA - Eternal Daughter and Kanga][kanga] (but, also, basically everything)
* [Blanck Mass][BlanckMass]

Occasionally.

* Dance with the Dead
* Holy Fuck
* Perturbator
