What I'm doing right now.

## Text

Getting into habit of updating site with notes and things.

Doing a decent job of updating Now and [Projects][]. Not doing as good a job at tending to my notes. Trying to carefully read [How to Take Smart Notes][smartnotes]

Check out my [Projects][] note.

## Gamedev

* Thinking about the name for the UI project... Some play on the UI thing, of course. Squiggle?
* Still thinking about next game project. Candidates:
  - Typing game
    + Wizards shooting spaceships to save the Earth!
  - Match 3
  - Top-down stealth thing maybe?

## Digital Games

* I'm basically playing no video games right now. Ugh.

## Role-playing Games

* [The Dracula Dossier][dracula] is very fun. We're in Europe. Close to Drac I think. Scary.
* I think my [Shadow of the Demon Lord][sotdl] game is dead. I don't blame the system, I blame me.
* Playing in a [Masks][] campaign with Internet strangers! A curated [Magpie][] game turned campaign. It's going great! Talk to me about the between-game vignettes.

## Teaching

Need to write more about what how my teaching is going.

## Programming

Mostly Terraform at work. Mostly JavaScript at home as I poke at my personal site and a notes system. Lua for anything gamedev-y, but I'm eyeing Rust.

## Music

Lately.

* Com Truise.
* Angel Olsen.
* Daniel Deluxe.

Always.

* [Carpenter Brut][carpenterbrut] - Basically everything
* [Makeup and Vanity Set][mavs] - Basically everything
* [ACTORS - It Will Come To You][actors]
* [KANGA - Eternal Daughter and Kanga][kanga] (but, also, basically everything)
* [Blanck Mass][BlanckMass]

Occasionally.

* Dance with the Dead
* Holy Fuck
* Perturbator
