## Overall

It's looking like it's going to be a beautiful Texas fall! Getting chilly and windy, with pleasant evenings.

## üé≤ Role-playing Games

Back for what is our final season of Masks with these characters! I haz a sad.

Reading up on Apocalypse Keys and Vaesen.

## üñ•Ô∏è Programming

When I wasn't looking the open-source game engine [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) got really cool! So I'm messing around with that in my spare time.

An enthusiastic member of the [anti-JavaScript JavaScript club](https://anti-javascript-javascript.club/).

## üé∂ Music

ON REPEAT: "Headlights" by Ashbury Heights.

Always.
