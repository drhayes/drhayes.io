What I'm doing right now.

## Text

Getting into habit of updating site with notes and things. Thinking about microblogging.

Check out my [Projects][] note.

## Gamedev

* [Squeak][] is alive!
* Thinking about the name for the UI project...
* Still thinking about next game project. Candidates:
  - Typing game
    + Wizards shooting spaceships to save the Earth!
  - Match 3
  - Top-down stealth thing maybe?

## Digital Games

* Beat [Carrion][]. It was great. Just play it.
* Haven't been able to convince my family to beat that final boss of [Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime][liads] yet. Our skills are rusting away!
* Trying to figure out what our [Minecraft][] gaming is going to look like, going forward.
* Starting to play [Shovel Knight][ShovelKnight] after reading the [Boss Fight Books book][shovel-knight-by-david-l-craddock]. Such a great game. Not NES hard... yet.

## Role-playing Games

* [The Dracula Dossier][dracula] is very fun. Still not dead, but I've been shot by goons a couple of times. That wasn't great.
* Running a campaign using [Shadow of the Demon Lord][sotdl], maybe. Hard to schedule. And the I-roll-you-roll-I-roll of combat isn't super exciting for me.
* Playing in a [Masks][] campaign with Internet strangers! A curated [Magpie][] game turned campaign. It's going great!

## Teaching

Thinking and reading about teaching adults. How to effectively communicate ideas and meet students where they're looking. What does my teaching language look like?

## Programming

I'm doing a lot of JavaScript, Lua, and Terraform these days. Always trying to get better at shell scripting. Paraphrasing the inestimable Merlin Mann, when I get a bit of shell scripting right I feel like a chimp that just successfully landed a jet.

## Music

Lately.

* [Sisters of Mercy][SistersOfMercy] - Anodyne to that kind of day, week, month, season...
* Hunter as a Horse

Always.

* [Carpenter Brut][carpenterbrut] - Basically everything
* [Makeup and Vanity Set][mavs] - Basically everything
* [ACTORS - It Will Come To You][actors]
* [KANGA - Eternal Daughter and Kanga][kanga] (but, also, basically everything)
* [Blanck Mass][BlanckMass]

Occasionally.

* Dance with the Dead
* Holy Fuck
