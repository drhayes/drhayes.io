## Overall

Endless tweaking of my personal site. Lots of CSS changes here and there, lots of changes to what gets generated (don't generate pages for tags used in a single place), trying to focus on the developer experience of working on my site and making that better.

I'm focused on how I can be a more effective mentor as well.

## Socials

I can now be found at [@drhayes@social.lol](https://social.lol/@drhayes).

You can also find me on [Bookwyrm](https://bookwyrm.social/user/drhayes). I'm trying to be good about what I'm logging, but no guarantees there.

## Text

[My Atom feed looks pretty, too!](/feed.xml)

I published [my principles](/principles/).

## Role-playing Games

Back for what is our final season of Masks with these characters! I haz a sad.

Reading up on Apocalypse Keys.

## Programming

These days most of the programming I'm doing is either related to this site or my game.

## Music
