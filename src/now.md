## Overall

Suffering in the Texas heat wave. Elevating my understanding of design and CSS.

## 📢 Socials

I can be found at [@drhayes@social.lol](https://social.lol/@drhayes).

You can also find me on [Bookwyrm](https://bookwyrm.social/user/drhayes). I'm trying to be good about what I'm logging.

## ✏️ Text

Thinking about relaxing and writing more for the site rather than getting caught up making things perfect.

## 🎲 Role-playing Games

Back for what is our final season of Masks with these characters! I haz a sad.

Reading up on Apocalypse Keys and Vaesen.

## 🖥️ Programming

These days most of the programming I'm doing is either related to this site or my game.

## 🎶 Music

ON REPEAT: "Temple of Love (1992)" by Sisters of Mercy

Lately.

- On a Makeup and Vanity Set kick.

Always.
