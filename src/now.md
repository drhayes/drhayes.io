## Overall

‚ùÑÔ∏è It's getting super chilly in Texas now! Dipping around freezing some nights.

## üé≤ Role-playing Games

Back for what is our final season of Masks with these characters! I haz a sad.

Reading up on Apocalypse Keys and Vaesen.

Playing around with [Homebrew World](https://spoutinglore.blogspot.com/2018/07/homebrew-world.html), thinking about running a game for my son.

## üñ•Ô∏è Programming

When I wasn't looking the open-source game engine [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) got really cool! So I'm messing around with that in my spare time. I dig the whole/part component model, the language is just fine for what I'm doing, and I'm mostly only interested in 2d stuff anyway. Thinking about moving away from pixel art, at least a little bit, and Godot seems like a fine way to do it.

An enthusiastic member of the [anti-JavaScript JavaScript club](https://anti-javascript-javascript.club/). My [anti-JavaScript JavaScript shirt](https://www.bonfire.com/anti-javascript-javascript-club/) got here and it's great!
