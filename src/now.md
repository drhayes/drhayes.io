What I'm doing right now.

## Fun Stuff

It's finally getting and staying cold around these parts. Getting ready to do the Thanksgiving thing. We have a lot to be thankful for, more than I think we can truly appreciate.

## Text

Ugh, I keep looking at [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and poking around in it. I don't like that it's an Electron app, but something about the standard(-ish) Markdown appeals a lot. I miss the structured nature of [Tiddlywiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/), though. I keep feeling like the jury is still out, but I also wonder if my brain hasn't decided already and it's taking the rest of my conscious mind a while to catch up.

## Role-playing Games

We're heading back to City of Mists!

## Programming

Experimenting with Go and [Charm][]. Is it possible to love a startup because of their TUI libraries? I'm living proof.

Still liking [LunarVim](https://www.lunarvim.org) a lot.

## Music

ON REPEAT: "Hard Times" by Paramore and "So Just Hang On, Beautiful One" by Au4.

Lately.

* Paramore
* Hunter As a Horse
* The Beta Machine

Always.

* [Carpenter Brut][carpenterbrut]
* [Makeup and Vanity Set][mavs]
* [ACTORS - It Will Come To You][actors]
* [KANGA - Eternal Daughter and Kanga][kanga] (but, also, basically everything)
* [Blanck Mass][BlanckMass]

Occasionally.

* Dance with the Dead
* Holy Fuck
* Perturbator


## What's this again?

This is a [Now][nowpage] page. You should have one too.
