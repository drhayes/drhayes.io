What I'm doing right now.

## Text

Writing more. Thinking about how to organize notes usefully. Almost getting sucked in by [doom emacs][doom].

Check out my [Projects][] note.

## Digital Games

* About to beat the final boss of [Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime][liads].
* Trying to get a [Breath of the Wild][botw] habit.
* Trying to figure out what our [Minecraft][] gaming is going to look like, going forward.

## Role-playing Games

* Starting a new campaign in [Night's Black Agents][nba] called [The Dracula Dossier][dracula].
* Running a campaign using [Shadow of the Demon Lord][sotdl].
* Reading through the [Quest][] book. Boy is it beautiful.
* Excited about going to [GenCon], virtually!
  - I'm playing [Bluebeard's Bride][bluebeard] and [Urban Shadows][urban] with some [Magpie] folks and **very excited**. Just. So. Excited.

## Teaching

Thinking and reading about teaching adults. How to effectively communicate ideas and meet students where they're looking. What does teaching language look like?

## Programming

I'm doing a lot of JavaScript, Lua, and Terraform these days. Always trying to get better at shell scripting. Paraphrasing the inestimable Merlin Mann, when I get a bit of shell scripting right I feel like a chimp that just successfully landed a jet.
