What I'm doing right now.

## Socials

I can now be found as [@drhayes@indieweb.social](https://indieweb.social/@drhayes). I'm also thinking about moving to <https://social.lol>, but we'll see.

Speaking of my preferred client, that would be https://elk.zone. Tres cool.

You can also find me on [Bookwyrm](https://bookwyrm.social/user/drhayes). I'm trying to be good about what I'm logging, but no guarantees.

## Text

Still thinking about a site design, haven't gotten around to it.

I was poking around [Zach Leatherman's own homepage](https://github.com/zachleat/zachleat.com) as a way of finding out 11ty features that I might not be aware of. I found the [eleventy-plugin-syntaxhighlight](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-plugin-syntaxhighlight) project which is *very* interesting. I'm using highlight.js on the server as part of the markdown render right now, but in general I tend to prefer prismjs, which this uses. Hmm!

## Role-playing Games

We're playing Capers, a hack of Masks that emphasizes teenage villains!

## Programming

But what about Rust, though?

Swapped my config to something more custom, all built off [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim).

## Music

ON REPEAT: "So Just Hang On, Beautiful One" by Au4 and "Light Cycles" by ShockOne.

Lately.

* On a Makeup and Vanity Set kick.

Always.

* [Carpenter Brut][carpenterbrut]
* [Makeup and Vanity Set][mavs]
* [ACTORS - It Will Come To You][actors]
* [KANGA - Eternal Daughter and Kanga][kanga] (but, also, basically everything)


## What's this again?

This is a [Now][nowpage] page. You should have one too.
