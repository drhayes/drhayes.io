## Overall

Texas in February is a weird month. I bet we've got one last freeze in us coming up, which I'm not looking forward to given how [previous ice storms](https://www.statesman.com/story/news/2022/01/04/246-texans-died-february-freeze-and-power-loss-officials-say/9080688002/) have gone for us.

## üé≤ Role-playing Games

Still Mask-ing it up. Still thinking about Vaesen and, possibly, running [Pasion de las Pasiones](https://magpiegames.com/pages/pasion).

## üñ•Ô∏è Programming

Still an enthusiastic member of the [anti-JavaScript JavaScript club](https://anti-javascript-javascript.club/). My [anti-JavaScript JavaScript shirt](https://www.bonfire.com/anti-javascript-javascript-club/) got here and it's great!

## üé∂ Music

ON REPEAT: "Headlights" by Ashbury Heights.

Always.
