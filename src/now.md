## Overall

Focused on my site, trying to brush up on the latest tech -- especially on the CSS side, with logical properties and more modern color representations. It's a work in progress.

We're gearing up for the new school year.

I'm focused on how I can be a more effective mentor as well.

## Socials

I can now be found at [@drhayes@social.lol](https://social.lol/@drhayes).

You can also find me on [Bookwyrm](https://bookwyrm.social/user/drhayes). I'm trying to be good about what I'm logging, but no guarantees there.

## Text

Finished the site redesign, at least for now. It looks a little bare but I'm going to leave it like this for a while, see what I think.

[My Atom feed looks pretty, too!](/feed.xml)

## Role-playing Games

Back for what is our final season of Masks with these characters!

## Programming

But what about Rust, though?

Swapped my nvim config to something more custom, all built off [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim).

## Music

ON REPEAT: "Temple of Love (1992)" by Sisters of Mercy

Lately.

Always.
