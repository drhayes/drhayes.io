What I'm doing right now.

## Text

Writing more. Thinking about how to organize notes usefully. Abandoning any potential emacs rabbit holes.

Check out my [Projects][] note.

## Digital Games

* Not making progress on any digital game things in any way right now.
* About to beat the final boss of [Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime][liads].
* Trying to start a [Breath of the Wild][botw] habit.
* Trying to figure out what our [Minecraft][] gaming is going to look like, going forward.

## Role-playing Games

* [The Dracula Dossier][dracula] is very fun. I'm having a blast. I'm successfully not dead nor a vampire... yet.
* Running a campaign using [Shadow of the Demon Lord][sotdl].
* [GenCon] was lots of fun!
* Excited about going to [GenCon], virtually!
  - [Bluebeard's Bride][bluebeard] was a hefty experience. Why am I having these deep and kinda controversial conversations with Internet strangers suddenly? Great game, still thinking about it.
  - I ended up *not* playing [Urban Shadows][urban], but instead played [the Root RPG][rootrpg]! I was excited to play... but the system didn't quite click with me. The people all were great and I had fun on that score, no doubt... but the system felt a little generic fantasy to me?

## Teaching

Thinking and reading about teaching adults. How to effectively communicate ideas and meet students where they're looking. What does my teaching language look like?

## Programming

I'm doing a lot of JavaScript, Lua, and Terraform these days. Always trying to get better at shell scripting. Paraphrasing the inestimable Merlin Mann, when I get a bit of shell scripting right I feel like a chimp that just successfully landed a jet.

## Music

Always.

* [Carpenter Brut][carpenterbrut]
* [ACTORS - It Will Come To You][actors]
* [KANGA - Eternal Daughter and Kanga][kanga]

Occasionally.

* Hunter as a Horse
* Dance with the Dead
* Holy Fuck
