[Play the game here][playblaster].

Blaster is the name of the twin-stick shooter I wrote as a break from building the _Big Game_ (which needs a better name!). Since that game is going to take me a very long time to build I figured I should take a break and build something simple and fun that wouldn't take me very long to complete, relatively speaking.

I also wanted to take the opportunity to write out a tutorial of sorts around how I put the game together, what my design decisions were, and what tools I used and found useful.

Blaster uses [Phaser][] and a host of web-based technologies.

Here is the [repository for the project][repo].
