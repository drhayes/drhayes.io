What I'm doing right now.

## Web stuff

Around the middle of June I started converting this site to use SvelteKit instead of 11ty. It was a
real pleasure to develop in, rendered quickly, and might be my favorite toolkit now. NextJS comes
next, I think. Svelte is awesome. React, slightly less so I think. Still working on that one.

## Text

Check out my [Projects][] note.

Working on a tumbley-loggy thing over at [wisps][]. Tags and editorializing work. But I still want
to add pictures and music and things.

Doing most of my note work in a private [Roam Research][roam] graph these days. Not sure how to
correlate that with my notes site. Maybe my notes site is more of a public writing thing than a
private research thing? But doesn't that miss the point? Or maybe me developing my writing in public
is good enough?

## Video Games

Working on [Hyperblaster][]! A super simple space shooter to prove that I can finish a game.

## Role-playing Games

* Playing in a [Masks][] campaign with Internet strangers! A curated [Magpie][] game turned campaign. It's going great! Talk to me about the between-game vignettes.
* [Beam Saber][beamsaber] is great fun! Turns out I like Forged in the Dark games a lot, but also
  have a lot to learn if I want to run one myself.

## Programming

[Work continues on the digital garden][drhayesdigitalgarden]. I've left the code alone for a while
now, it's working for me. Been thinking about adding tag pages, also been thinking about adding some
kind of crude search engine.

Messing about in [Svelte][].

## Music

ON REPEAT: [MAYDAY by TheFatRat featuring Laura Brehm][mayday]

Lately.

* TheFatRat.
* Daniel Deluxe.
* John Carpenter.
* Instrumental Gunship. Not sure how I feel about Gunship.
* Rez soundtrack, just so bangin'.

Always.

Occasionally.
