What I'm doing right now.

## Web stuff

Playing around with Svelte.

1. did
2. this
3. work?

## Text

Trying to stay in the habit of updating my site on the regular. Not doing great on that front.

Check out my [Projects][] note.

Working on a tumbley-loggy thing over at [wisps][]. Tags and editorializing work. But I still want
to add pictures and music and things.

Doing most of my note work in a private [Roam Research][roam] graph these days. Not sure how to
correlate that with my notes site. Maybe my notes site is more of a public writing thing than a
private research thing? But doesn't that miss the point? Or maybe me developing my writing in public
is good enough?

## Role-playing Games

* Playing in a [Masks][] campaign with Internet strangers! A curated [Magpie][] game turned campaign. It's going great! Talk to me about the between-game vignettes.
* [Beam Saber][beamsaber] is great fun! Turns out I like Forged in the Dark games a lot, but also
  have a lot to learn if I want to run one myself.

## Programming

[Work continues on the digital garden][drhayesdigitalgarden]. I've left the code alone for a while
now, it's working for me. Been thinking about adding tag pages, also been thinking about adding some
kind of crude search engine.

Doing lots of interesting (but probably basic) database stuff at work these days.

Thinking about going [NextJS][nextjs] for the personal site. MDX seems just too cool. Or maybe it
should be Svelte? Argh.

## Music

ON REPEAT: [MAYDAY by TheFatRat featuring Laura Brehm][mayday]

Lately.

* TheFatRat.
* Daniel Deluxe.
* John Carpenter.
* Instrumental Gunship. Not sure how I feel about Gunship.
* Rez soundtrack, just so bangin'.

Occasionally.
