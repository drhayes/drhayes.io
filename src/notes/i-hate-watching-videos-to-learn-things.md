title: I Hate Watching Videos to Learn Things

I read pretty fast and I'm easily distracted, so watching your twenty minute video about a topic that could just as easily been written down in three paragraphs is pretty frustrating for me.

Is it because video production is easier than writing well? Uncharitably, I suspect it's because rambling into a camera ends up being more engaging for audiences than a carefully edited article. Then again, this site is proof that you don't have to edit that carefully to get things going.

This is part of my belief in the [supremacy of text][sot].
