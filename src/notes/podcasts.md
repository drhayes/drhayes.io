The podcasts I can't stop listening to:

## [Sounds Like Crowes][crowes]

Hands down my favorite podcast, it's an actual-play podcast of a bunch of folks playing a role-playing game, [Savage Worlds][savageworlds]. It's heavily edited and well acted and when a new episode comes out I switch to it immediately.

## [Omen's Call][omens]

Made by the same group that makes Sounds Like Crowes, Omen's Call is an actual-play that uses [Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition][dnd]. They are playing in the [setting of Midgard][midgard].

## [Coffee With Butterscotch][butterscotch]

A gamedev comedy podcast by one of my favorite indie studios, Butterscotch Shenanigans. I not only like hearing their takes on the games industry but I also like hearing their approach to devops in managing their studio. A lot of what they say is applicable not just to their industry but the broader software industry at large.

And, I mean, I really liked their game Crashlands (though it took me an embarassingly long time to finish) but [the story behind it is an amazing must-watch tear-jerker][lastgameimakebeforeidie]. My deep respect for all of them lives on so many levels.

## [Pretending To Be People][ptbp]

A crazy, not-edited-at-all-that-I-can-tell Cthulhuian romp of an actual-play podcast run with a modified [Delta Green][deltagreen] ruleset. They're weirdly hilarious and smart.

## [Red Moon Roleplaying][redmoon]

Horror! Creepiness! My best source for [KULT][kdl] actual plays. The GMs, players, and guests are usually fully bought-in to playing the horror vibe and don't mess around.
