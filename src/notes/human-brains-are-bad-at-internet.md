description: It's like the Internet was made to destroy our brains. At least, certain forms of it.

It's clear to me that our raised-on-the-savannah brains are not made to respond well to an advertiser-soaked Internet interested in buzzing us algorithmically to generate clicks.

Since that form of the Internet isn't going away for a while, what can we do meanwhile to strengthen our brains against these kinds of attacks?

Generalized social networks like Twitter and Facebook seem especially programmed to take advantage of this in a particularly nasty way and I've rejected them at this point. At least Reddit segments into self-assigned interest groups that (nominally) stay on topic.

I think algorithmic moderation is, generally, a failure and doesn't serve those who most need it.
