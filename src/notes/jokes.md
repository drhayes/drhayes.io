A small town erects a bell tower in the steeple in the church. Only after it is built does the priest realize that try have nobody who can ring the bell, because everyone has their own jobs they must do every day. The butcher is busy, the cobbler is busy, etc.

A few days later, a man comes to the priest with an offer to be the bell ringer. He explains that he has no job and no responsibilities and wants to help his town.

At this point, the priest realizes that the man has no arms.

"Sir, thank you for your offer, but I'm order to ring the bell, you must be able to life the hammer," the priest explains.

The No Armed man disagrees. "Come up to the tower with me. I can show you that I can do this job."

So the priest follows the man all the way up the bell tower. He tells the priest to step aside before running full speed at the large bell an slamming his face into it, producing a loud "DONG" sound.

"My goodness!" The priest says. "Are you ok?!"

The man assures the priest that he is fine and is more than capable of taking on this responsibility.

The priest gives him the job.

For months, on the hour, the No Armed Man runs full speed at the bell and rings it for the whole town to hear. Until one day, tragedy strikes.

The man misses the 8th DONG at 10am on Sunday and tumbles out of the bell tower just after church, in full view of the congregation.

The group gathers around him.

"Who is that No Armed man?" One person asks.

"I don't know, but his face rings a bell."

Meanwhile, the No Armed Man's twin brother goes to the priest. He explains that this is a tragedy, but he would like to take up the mantle of his now-deceased brother.

Again, the brother has no arms.

The priest is hesitant, but the No Armed Brother insists that they go up to the bell tower so he can prove that he can do it. After all, the town still needs two more DONGs so that everyone will know it's 10am.

Again, the priest leads a man with no arms to the top of the bell tower, and the brother runs full speed at the bell.

And misses on his first try. He, too, tumbles from the tower and smashes into the ground below.

The crowd turns to the new corpse.

"Now who is THIS?"

"I don't know, but he's a dead ringer for that guy over there."
