## Code

  * [Gemini Rising][gr]
    - On brief hiatus while I work on games that won't take me four more years to complete.
    - Need to blog about that.
  * Beehive.lua
    - Pulling the behavior tree implementation out of Gemini Rising and making it open source.
    - Will learn about maintaining Lua packages, something I have no experience with.
    - Include tests.
    - Include Makefile?
    - Include examples?
