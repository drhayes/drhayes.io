## Code

  * [Gemini Rising][gr]
    - On brief hiatus while I work on games that won't take me four more years to complete.
    - Need to write about that hiatus.
  * Beehive.lua
    - Released at https://github.com/drhayes/beehive.lua
  * Surrender
    - A short game that is entirely a boss fight from an earlier game.
  * Squeaky.lua
    - A love2d framework for making games.
    - Still thinking about how to organize it and what to publish.
