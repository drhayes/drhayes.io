## Code

  * [Gemini Rising][gr]
    - On brief hiatus while I work on games that won't take me four more years to complete.
    - Need to write about that hiatus.
  * Beehive.lua
    - Released at https://github.com/drhayes/beehive.lua
  * ~~Surrender~~
    - A short game that is entirely a boss fight from an earlier game.
    - On hold for a bit.
  * Squeak.lua
    - A LÖVE framework for making games.
    - Still thinking about how to organize it and what to publish.
  * [Generic Platformer][platformer]
    - Example LÖVE codebase using proto-Squeak and proto-Squick.
  * Squick.lua
    - Keyboard-accessible UI framework.
    - Name might change, just putting it out there to think about it a bit.
