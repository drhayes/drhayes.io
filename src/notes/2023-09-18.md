Yup, just a weird thing I was trying to see if it would work. And it did. And I'm not sure what I'm going to do with it now that it's working.

I was thinking I could use it for longer replies to people that I could then use as a kind of supporting writing for other, even longer pieces on the website. So the "notes" stuff feeds into the bigger "writing" stuff. I wanted to get "backlinks" working for the notes, so someone could see what linked to them to follow the thoughts around the site.

I'm calling them notes [because that's what Indieweb calls them](https://indieweb.org/note). ü§∑üèΩ

I'm not convinced I'm going to keep doing this, but it's pretty cool to see it work.
