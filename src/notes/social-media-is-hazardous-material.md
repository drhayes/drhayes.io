I almost wrote "social media is toxic" but it's not *all* bad, just its most common, popular forms like Facebook and Twitter. So it's not all toxic, it just requires very careful handling. And we tend not to do that.

I think it's closely related to [human brains being bad at Internet][badbrains]. We don't understand our consciousness and sentience and identities enough to appreciate what happens if we collide at high speed with other humans' filtered social media output. And, of course, it is filtered both by the humans on the other end and the intermediaries with captilasim-driven, advertising-based motives.

And given that [words mean things][words], we hoover up a bunch of filtered words of dubious motivation at our peril.
