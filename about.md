# About

My name is David Hayes. I do stuff with computers. I live in Austin, TX.

This site is made with some help from these technologies and media:

* [Sublime Text 3][sublime] is where the typing happens.
* [Markdown][] has the content.
* [Jekyll][] generates the site.
* [Gitlab][] hosts the code.
* [Netlify][] publishes the site.
* [Cloudflare][] makes it fast.

## Contact Me

I can be found pretty much everywhere as `drhayes` or some variation.

In particular, you can email me at <a href="mailto:drhayes@gmail.com">drhayes@gmail.com</a> or chat me at <a href="https://t.me/drhayes">@drhayes on Telegram</a> and I might even answer.
