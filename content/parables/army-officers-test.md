## Problem

You are a lieutenant in the army. In front of you is a sergeant, two privates, fifty feet of rope, a twenty foot pole, and an American flag. In 30 seconds or less, erect a flagpole.

How do you do it?

## Solution

"Sergeant, get that flagpole up."

## What?

* Delegation is a pillar of leadership.
* Sometimes the how doesn't matter, only the what.
* Sometimes you're too far away from the problem to solve it correctly.
* Sometimes you should get out of the way of people with different skills and let them do their job.
* You can't do everything. Don't try.
